Last version.

Wanted to add another end condition to force it to create new generation. Every 30 seconds. It worked fine...BUT if you paused it it renders the timing useless. So it was either remove the pause feature
or ignore timing the generation cycle.

I may put the timing back in during testing and never pause it. Undecided. I could just disable the pause button.

The readme is about finished. Will need to send it out to people to test and answer a simple questionnaire.
