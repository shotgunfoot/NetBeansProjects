Lots of progress. Lots of bugs.

Most note worthy bugs : 

->All agents at some point get stuck running into walls or corners.

->Predator agents get confused trying to switch targets. Currently it constantly swaps out the target. Need to make it focus on only one target until vision finds another.

->

Things that are not completed : 

->Escape behaviour is not implemented for the prey bots.

->Not expending energy when running around (maybe) Might want to make it an additive only thing and have it count towards fitness value in the GA

->The genetic algorithm
